Welcome to the LUSID Python Preview SDK
=======================================

This Sphinx-built HTML doc set is designed to make it easier to navigate the modules, classes, methods and exceptions in the LUSID Python Preview SDK.

The Preview SDK contains beta and experimental APIs not yet available in the canonical Python SDK.

For all other information, start with the SDK's `Github repo README <https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-python-preview>`_.
