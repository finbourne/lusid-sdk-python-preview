**scheme_name** | **str** | The type of the industry classification scheme (TRBC, GICs, ICB) | 
**scheme_id** | **str** | Within the given scheme, the unique id that identifies this particular classification.  e.g. within \&quot;TRCS\&quot;, 5010202011 identifies \&quot;Oil Exploration \\amp; Production - Onshore\&quot; within the Energy, fossil-fuels and Oil hierarchy. |
