# ComplexMarketData

Base class for representing complex market data in LUSID.  Generally speaking, market data is complex when it cannot be represented as a single quote.  Examples include discounting curves, projection curves, and volatility surfaces, which are used to compute instrument analytics.  This base class should not be directly instantiated; each supported MarketDataType has a corresponding inherited class.
