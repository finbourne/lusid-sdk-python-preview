# ValuationsReconciliationRequest

Specification for the reconciliation request. Left and Right hand sides are constructed. Each consists of a valuation of a portfolio  using an aggregation request. The results of this can then be compared to each other. The difference, which is effectively a risk based  difference allows comparison of the effects of changing a recipe, valuation date, or (though it may or may not make logical sense) a portfolio.  For instance, one might look at the difference in risk caused by the addition of transaction to a portfolio, or through changing the valuation  methodology or system.
