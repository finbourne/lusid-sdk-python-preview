# LusidInstrument

Base class in hierarchy for LUSID Instruments. Valuation would normally be performed through passing LUSID a Code for a portfolio to be valued.  In that case the set of instruments have already been uploaded. Equally, one might wish to pass in a set of instruments directly and have LUSID  value the inlined set. This the base instrument for this case.
